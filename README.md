# Missouri Diabetes Rate Analysis
This project analyzes the socioeconomic, healthcare access, and food insecurity factors that influence diabetes rates across Missouri counties. By combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and machine learning, the goal is to understand which community-level challenges contribute most to diabetes prevalence. These insights can support policymakers, public health organizations, and local leaders in designing targeted programs that improve healthcare access, reduce financial strain, and promote healthier living conditions for at-risk populations.
